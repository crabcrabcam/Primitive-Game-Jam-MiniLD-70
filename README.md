# Primitive-Game-Jam-MiniLD-70
How fast can I make the most basic game there is? Well let's find out!

â€‹Did this over the weekend just so I'd actually finish a game. I tried to make it as polished as possible so if you do find any bugs please do tell me so I can get them fixed. I might add some new levels but I'm really bad at art (that's why the entire game is made from 1x1 pixels...) and I can't really make good levels :( 
The theme for the MiniLD was "Determinism", so I have used no randomness. The game feels as un-random as possible. The enemies move in set patterns (left to right :P) and the movement never changes. 
The theme for the Primitive Game Jam was "broken" so I made the level design be in pieces. Especially the second level. Some of the rest may not have held up to this, but they are broken pieces of ground in space!
